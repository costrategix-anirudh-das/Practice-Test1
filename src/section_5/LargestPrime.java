/*

Write a method named getLargestPrime with one parameter of type int named number. 

If the number is negative or does not have any prime numbers, the method should return -1 to indicate an invalid value.

The method should calculate the largest prime factor of a given number and return it.

HINT: Since the numbers 0 and 1 are not considered prime numbers, they cannot contain prime numbers.

NOTE: The method getLargestPrime â€‹should be defined as public static like we have been doing so far in the course.

NOTE: Do not add a main method to the solution code.
